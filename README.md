# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch

Basic implementation of some of the most used Machine Learning algorithms:
* *Linear Regression*: Used to find the best linear relationship between Data 
* *KNN*: Used to classify Data point based on the K Nearest Neighbors of the trained model
* *K Means*: Used to cluster data into K groups in an unsupervised manner.

Everything was developed from scratch to practice and demonstrate how some of the most powerful Machine Learning techniques can be implemented with relative ease. This exercise is also very useful to understand the underlying mechanics of each algorithm, which helps into the decision of which ML algorithm to use for a specific scenario.
